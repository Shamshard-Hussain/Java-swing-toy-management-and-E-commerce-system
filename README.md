This is a simple toy management and E-commerce system implemented with Java Swing, 
which utilizes text file handling to store toy data.



The full project will be available soon. Currently, 
only the registration and login GUI are available here.



Users need to enter valid data for registration:

    First name and last name should consist of letters only.
    The email address should be in the correct format.
    The password should be at least 8 characters long.
    The password and confirm password fields should match.
    Users cannot register with an email address that is already registered.


Users can log in using their registered account credentials.
The admin username is 'admin,' and the password is '1234.'
